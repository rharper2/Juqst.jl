    "Let's say you wanted to generate all the two qubit Cliffords, but you don't want to use the CNOT gate, but rather the CZ gate. You have a single qubit X gate, Z gate and Phase gate as well as a Hadamard which you can apply to either or both qubits. How would you generate the full two qubit group using only these Cliffords?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a lot of this book we will be working in the superoperator basis, so our Clifford operators are expressed as super-operators. The reason I do this is because the superoperator basis is 'projective' - it projects out the global phase. This makes it really easy to see if two operators are in fact the same. \n",
